# Notable Projects  
- 🚀 [Email Spam Detection Using ML](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ABHI010/NIKHIL14) – Developed and deployed an ML-based email spam classifier using 5,000 Kaggle and 90,000 synthetic emails, achieving 99.52% accuracy, 100% precision, and 99.01% recall. Deployed a Gradio web app for real-time detection with interactive retraining, improving model accuracy by 5% and reducing false positives by 30%.  
- 🌍 [Image Recognition with CNN](https://github.com/nikhildatascience/cnn-image-classification-tensorflow) – Built a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras to classify 10,000 clothing images into 10 categories, achieving 89% test accuracy (to be updated to 92% upon completion). Applied preprocessing, normalization, and regularization techniques to reduce overfitting.  
- 🌐 [SDGs in the Classroom – NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024](https://sdginclass.godaddysites.com/) – Developed an innovative educational platform integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with space data.
